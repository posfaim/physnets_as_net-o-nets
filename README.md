The repository contains three parts:

1. figures: a collection of Jupyter notebooks that reproduce the four figures in the main text of 2306.01583
2. simulations: a python extension written in c++ to generate random physical networks from random walk trajectories. To build the package run: `python setup.py build_ext --inplace`
3. data: data and simulation results needed to reproduce figures
